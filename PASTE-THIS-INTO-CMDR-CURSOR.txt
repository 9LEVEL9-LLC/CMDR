🎯 CMDR PLATFORM - CURSOR AI INSTRUCTIONS

Hi! I need your help deploying and rebranding this platform.

📖 READ FIRST:
- CMDR-CURSOR-PROMPT.md (your complete instructions)
- CMDR-MIGRATION-GUIDE.md (deployment steps)

🎯 YOUR MISSION:
1. Help me deploy this to GitHub and Render
2. Migrate the database from nBrain
3. Rebrand everything "nBRAIN" → "CMDR"
4. Integrate MY existing CMDR homepage (ask me for location)
5. Apply MY CMDR color scheme (ask me for colors)
6. Remove ALL nBRAIN logos - use text "CMDR" only

⚠️ KEY RULES:
- DO NOT use nBRAIN homepage design
- DO NOT keep any nBRAIN branding
- DO ask me for CMDR brand colors before changing design
- DO ask me for CMDR homepage location
- DO follow CMDR-CURSOR-PROMPT.md exactly

🚀 START BY:
1. Confirming you've read CMDR-CURSOR-PROMPT.md
2. Asking me about:
   - GitHub repo status
   - CMDR brand colors (primary, secondary, accent, background, text)
   - CMDR homepage file location
   - Whether I'm ready to begin deployment

Let's build the CMDR platform! 🎯
